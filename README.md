### My article: [Google's Gemini Pro Beats GPT-4](https://analyticsindiamag.com/googles-gemini-pro-beats-gpt-4/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This article was an interesting read about Google's Gemini Pro overtaking OpenAI's GPT-4 on the HuggingFace Chat Bot Arena leaderboard. In my opinion, the leaderboard is a unique and interesting way to rank chat bots, featuring an elo system with confidence index. It is worth noting that while Gemini Pro overtook GPT-4, it still ranks second behind OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo. Gemini Pro is also not Google's most powerful model. That spot is taken by Gemini Ultra whose capabilities has no been revealed yet. With Meta's Llama 3 on the horizon with expectations to surpass GPT-4 and OpenAI's announcement that GPT-5 is in the works, it will be interesting to see how powerful these future models will become and how they affect software engineers.

Hey, I found it interesting that we both chose articles relating to AI and chat modals. Overall, I'm kinda rooting for llama 3 to be the best. While Meta dosen't have the best track record overall, I love how they made llama 2 and hopefully 3 open source. I think that doing so can allow a lot of hobby developers and start-ups to have a competative chance in the space dominated by tech giants.
